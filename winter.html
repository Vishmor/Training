      <h2>Hot or Cold Beet-Fennel Soup</h2>
      <p>We love a hearty meal that can warm us up when it’s snowy just as much as we crave light and fresh eats on sticky summer nights. But few recipes can satisfy in all<br>
        seasons like this beet and fennel soup from Dorie Greenspan’s cookbook Everyday Dorie. Made from a blend of humble vegetables and herbs, the versatile dish can be served<br>
        hot or cold, depending on where the weather (or your mood) guides you. Be sure to share it — that striking red hue demands to be seen by dinner guests, family and co-workers<br>
        alike.
