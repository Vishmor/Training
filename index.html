      <h2>Fill the table with a spread so glorious in turns into a brupper</h2>
      <p>The brunch we're imagining is a sprawling affair. It isn't fancy, but it happens over a luxurious amount of time, so that people can really sit and talk — and eat to their heart's content.<br> 
        It's the kind of brunch that could easily turn into brupper. There are no rules, save for putting both savoury and sweet dishes on offer. While brunch usually includes something boozy, like<br>
        our truly magnificent Caesar recipes, consider adding a non-boozy cocktail option as well. Don't forget your vegan friends either. We've got something for everyone in this sizable list of recipes.<br>
        When it comes to brunch you can really add any of your favourite dishes to the mix, especially if they're great for sharing and grazing. If you hit the three-hour mark and someone is taking the <br>
        once-hot pancakes and using them to sandwich things, you've done an excellent job.
