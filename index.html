        <p>We're big fans of giving homemade food as gifts to people we love, surprising them with delicious, savoury meals or batches of baked goods to brighten their day.<br>
          It's a particularly good time for sharing the feel-good foods we've collected below â€” ones that feel like a real treat on a wintry day.<br>
          The recipes we've selected range from simple bakes to labours of love, with freezer-friendly dishes, savoury and sweet pies, breakfasts you can bake for an early-morning<br>
          surprise, and comforting soups and stews. They all make great Valentine's Day gifts, and we've included some cookies and chocolatey confections more traditionally<br>
          associated with the day too.
        </p>
        <p>There are no rules, save for putting both savoury and sweet dishes on offer. While brunch usually includes something boozy, like<br>
          our truly magnificent Caesar recipes, consider adding a non-boozy cocktail option as well. Don't forget your vegan friends either. We've got something for everyone in this sizable list of recipes.<br>
          When it comes to brunch you can really add any of your favourite dishes to the mix, especially if they're great for sharing and grazing.
