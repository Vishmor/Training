      <h2>Caesar recipe to invite to your next brunch</h2>
      <p>On a certain Sunday, you might find yourself hosting a 'big-deal brunch', one where your menu is designed to impress, and only the souped-up Caesar below (the 'eh' <br>
        in its name should hint to you that peameal bacon and many other Canada-famous foods are within) will do as the cocktail to round it out. On another Sunday, you may be<br>
        serving little more than simple classics, and the stripped down — but perfect — recipe below will be your go-to. But never forget your vegetarian and vegan guests; our<br>
        fishy-free version has a vegan 'Clamato' base that is as robust as the real thing. (And we hope that it goes without saying that you can skip the vodka to make any of <br>
        these alcohol free, always!) 
      </p>
