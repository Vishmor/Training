      <h2>Flourless Lemon Ricotta Cake with Almonds</h2>
      <p>Almond flour and almond meal both work well in this recipe. Almond flour is made from blanched and peeled raw almonds, and has a very pale, unified colour.<br> 
        Almond meal is made from unpeeled raw almonds, which makes a speckle-coloured flour that gives baked goods a darker appearance. You can make your own using a >br>
        high-power food processor or blender: working in small batches, blitz almonds until a fine dust is achieved (stop before it turns to nut butter).<br>
        Sift into a container and return any almond bits back to the food processor to re-blitz. Store in the freezer, in an airtight container, for up to three months.
